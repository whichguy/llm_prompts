## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR ULTRA FAT FIRE WITH COMPLEX EQUITY COMPENSATION**

### **🔬 FORENSIC-LEVEL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS**

```
**THE MILLION-DOLLAR DETAILS THAT MATTER:**

1. **Stock Options ≠ Stock Value**: Net value after exercise costs and taxes
2. **RSUs ≠ Gross Value**: Net value after tax withholding at vest  
3. **Geographic Arbitrage**: Can equal multiple years of spending for high earners
4. **Institution Discovery**: Systematic enumeration prevents major asset omissions
5. **Verification Gates**: Client confirmation prevents cascading errors
6. **Tax Treatment**: Each equity type requires different tax analysis
7. **Bridge Period**: Must use NET values, not gross employer equity values

**For Ultra FAT FIRE clients with complex equity compensation, tax implications can swing results by millions of dollars and completely change the retirement timeline. Therefore, forensic-level detail in tax treatment is MANDATORY, not optional.**
```

This revised prompt incorporates all the key learnings:
- **Systematic asset discovery** to prevent omissions
- **Forensic employer equity analysis** with proper tax treatment
- **Verification gates** throughout the process  
- **Enhanced geographic arbitrage** as a priority strategy
- **Tax-aware calculations** that use net values rather than gross values

The framework is designed to catch the types of errors identified in the analysis while maintaining the comprehensive Ultra FAT FIRE planning approach.
